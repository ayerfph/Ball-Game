# Ball-Game: Pygame with Copilot AI Integration


## Info:
- I continue my practice in pygame [Check my previous project here](https://github.com/ayerfph/Pygame-Practice-Bouncing-Ball)
- I'm using VSCode, Pygame Library, Copilot AI for fixing bugs, updates, and create new features.
- I start the project from a ball bounces in line, and now goes in this type of game.
